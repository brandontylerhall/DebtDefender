# About Debt Defender
While we understand Debt Defender is a CS II class project, we also aim to provide users with the ability to efficiently aggregate their income and expenditure data to obtain a holistic view on their financial health. 
While primitive in its current state, we aim to have Debt Defender evolve into a web application, fit with a user-friendly GUI and all.

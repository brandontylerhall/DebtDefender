# About
While being a CS II class project, Debt Defender also aims to provide users with the ability to efficiently aggregate their income and expenditure data to obtain a holistic view of their financial health. While primitive in its current state (as of 12 Nov, there is literally no code lol), we aim to have Debt Defender eventually evolve into a web application with an intuitive GUI.

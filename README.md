# About
While we understand Debt Defender is a CS II class project, we also aim to provide users with the ability  to efficiently aggregate their income and expenditure data to obtain a holistic view on their financial health. While primitive in its current state, we aim to have Debt Defender evolve into a web application, fit with a user-friendly GUI and all.

# Main functionality goals
1. Allow user to add, remove, and categorize their income data
2. Allow user to add, remove, and categorize their expense data
3. Allow the user to have their expenses broken down into aggregated data points, such as:
   1. Item name
   2. Item category
   3. Entry amount
      1. Top 3 categories by amount
      2. Further broken down into top 3 amounts within each category
      3. Gives total expense per category as a whole
   4. Income to expenditure ratio
4. Allow user to export their data to a .csv file for easier viewing

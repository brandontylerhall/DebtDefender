# About
While being a CS II class project, Debt Defender also aims to provide users with the ability to efficiently aggregate their income and expenditure data to obtain a holistic view of their financial health. While primitive in its current state (as of 12 Nov, there is literally no code lol), we aim to have Debt Defender eventually evolve into a web application with an intuitive GUI.

# Implementation Goals
1. Allow user to add, remove, and categorize their income data
2. Allow user to add, remove, and categorize their expense data
3. Allow user to have their expenses broken down in the following ways:
   1. Entry name
   2. Entry category
      1. Top 3 categories by amount
      2. Further breaks down into top 3 within each category
      3. Gives total expense per category as a whole
   3. Entry amount
   4. Income to expenditure ratio
4. Allow user to export their data to a .csv file for easier viewing
